# Media Compressor Web App - Netlify Deployment Ready

We've successfully configured the Media Compressor web app for deployment on Netlify. Here's a summary of the changes made:

## 1. Static Export Configuration
- Modified `next.config.js` to enable static export
- Added environment variables support for backend URL
- Resolved API route conflicts with static export

## 2. Netlify Configuration
- Created `netlify.toml` with build settings and redirects
- Added Netlify Functions for API proxying
- Configured environment variables for production

## 3. API Handling
- Updated API endpoint handling to work with both local development and Netlify
- Created serverless functions to proxy API requests to the backend
- Improved error handling for backend connectivity

## 4. Download Functionality
- Enhanced file download to work through Netlify Functions
- Added ZIP download support through API proxy
- Implemented fallbacks for different hosting environments

## 5. Testing Tools
- Created `test-netlify-build.sh` script for testing the production build
- Set up local server options for testing API connectivity
- Added comprehensive documentation on deployment

## Deployment Instructions

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Set up a new site on Netlify, connecting to your repository
3. Configure these environment variables in Netlify:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`: Your backend API URL
   - `BACKEND_URL`: Same as above (used by Netlify Functions)
4. Deploy!

## Testing Before Deployment

Run the test script to verify everything works:
```bash
./test-netlify-build.sh
```

This will build the project and serve it locally, similar to how it will run on Netlify.

## Customization

If you need to make adjustments to the Netlify configuration:
1. Modify `netlify.toml` for build settings and redirects
2. Update Netlify Functions in the `netlify/functions` directory
3. Adjust environment variables as needed

Refer to `NETLIFY_README.md` for more detailed deployment instructions.
